# Installing TypeScript

This is a skeleton app for people who want to use TypeScript in ExpressJS. A docker-compose file is included for those who want to run it in a container.

You don't have to use the docker-compose file if you're fine with installing NodeJS and NPM locally. Feel free to delete it if that's the case.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed (preferably the LTS version). This will also install `npm`. For Windows users you might consider [Chocolaty](https://chocolatey.org) and for Mac users obviously [Brew](https://brew.sh). These are both package managers that will help you install and update all kinds of packages via the CLI. Highly recommended. 

1. Open a terminal window (command prompt, git bash, powershell)
2. Check if NodeJS is installed by typing `node --version` into the terminal. It should print a line with something like `v18.18.0`.
3. Check if NPM is installed by typing  `npm --version` into the terminal. It should print a line with something like `9.8.0`.

## Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Compile the project by running `npm run build`. If you want to run the build script everytime you make changes automatically, you can use `npm run watch`.
5. Run the application. You cannot just open the `index.html` file (see the following section). If everything worked properly, you should see "Hello World" printed to the document. 

## Recommended VS Code Extension
 - To use the provided `.editorconfig` file, install the [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/#download) plugin.
 - To use the provided `.eslintrc.cjs` file, install the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) plugin.

## Using Docker

If you're like me and you dislike NodeJS and NPM piling up heaps of folders on your pc, run TypeScript in Docker!

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Open a terminal window (Powershell on Windows, regular command prompt will not work).
3. Clone this repository.
4. Move to this folder inside the terminal.
5. Run `docker-compose up` and open a new terminal OR run `docker-compose up -d` which allows you to work in the same terminal.
6. Follow the steps from [Instructions](#instructions) from step 4, but prefix all the commands with `docker-compose exec ts-app`.
7. Close the docker container by pressing `ctrl` + `c` or `docker-compose down`, respectively for step 5

# Running the project

Running 
In the package.json you can see which commands (in scripts) are used to run or build the server.

- `npm run dev`: in the dev environment we use this command to actually compile the TS code
- `npm run build`: before the dev environment becomes the production environment we use this command
- `npm run start`: in production we use this command the start a server in production
- `npm run start_ts`: in development we use this command the start a server with typescript files

One note on running the command `npm run start`. We use nodemon to monitor the node server and to restart the server automatically. If we use `node start.js` we have to restart the server ourselves. You could install the nodemon package globally, but in this repo we installed it locally.

## Modules

We use ES6 module system to import and export modules.

## Variables.env

We save credentials to other services in a `variables.env` file. This file is included in this template. However, it is common use not to include it in a public repository. There are some default key value pairs included to demonstrate its working.

## Ports

You can change the ports of your server via `variables.env`

## Run TS directly via Nodemon

We choose to compile TS to JS and run the compiled JS to test it. However it is possible to run typescript in express [Nodemon and TS](https://blog.logrocket.com/configuring-nodemon-with-typescript/)

For setting up the TS we used this [source](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-nodejs/nodejs-typescript/#step-2-installing-and-configuring-typescript)

## Database connectivity
In this project [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/introduction/what-is-prisma) is used for Object Relation Mapping. It comes with all kind of utilities as models, seeds and migrationd
